## Project Title

Apple Website Recreated Using React

## Introduction

This project shows how the current Apple's website can be recreated using React. It also demonstrates how we can use Bootstrap along with React to build a responsive website.

## Description

To rebuild Apple's current website, I created components for various pages using React. The app implements routing by passing each path/page and rendering the components for each page based on the page's URL. If the user navigates to a wrong path or a path that not defined by the route, a separate component is included to display a 404 page. I imported switch component that react router provides to render the defined paths, but to show the 404 page when the path user entered does not match the defined pages.
